# Things I learned about css

A very unstructured list I will likely forget to update.

1. Cascading Style Sheets cascade. If I set styling for 'img' in the css file for a help component, and then include that in my help.js file, but don't specify that its only for img tags that are children of the 'help' class elements, then other components will inherit this style. using '.help img {}' resolved this issue.
2. More to come I am but a novice.
