    "What is this?": "This is my website! I made it to learn react and to have a website to put in when applying for jobs.",
    "Who are you?": "I am David Winkenwerder. I have a roommateand two cats who I love very much.I like to program and play games. I'm partial to D & D and talk about my campaign much more often than I write for it.",
    "Why did you style it like this?": "I wanted to create a website that reminded me of some of my earliest fond memories with computers.I have very fond memories of playing Oregon Trail and Mathblaster in the computer - lab at my elementary school.And drawing in MS paint when I was spending time with my Grandfather at his office. I was also heavily inspired by < a href = 'https://dev.to/smpnjn/using-only-css-to-recreate-windows-98-47b1' >this article</a > which made a windows98 like interface with pure CSS, as well as < a href = 'https://jdan.github.io/98.css/' > this project</a > which provided a css library for windows98 like styling.I ended up not using this library, but it is still very cool.",
    "What's on here?": "At the moment? Not a lot. I'm trying to embrace the mantra 'better not perfect than not done'.\n That said, currently windows can be opened, closed, dragged, and resized.I hope to use this site as a way to track my projects and write occaisional blogs.It would be nice to have something to look back on and see my own growth.Especially something I control and maintain without ceding control to an external entity like github or facebook.",
    "Can I play Minesweeper?": "Not yet."
