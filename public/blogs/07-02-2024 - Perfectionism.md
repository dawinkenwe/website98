# Perfectionism

I've been struggling with perfectionism a lot recently. Somehow I got the idea that something is only worth doing if it is done perfectly. It's been preventing me from doing at all. I really wanted to get this website up quickly, because I wanted it to be practice in prioritizing completion over perfection.

Results have been mixed. I originally wanted to publish this by the first of July 2024. Given that I started work on it around the 24th of June 2024, that may have been an overly optimistic goal. Now that the website is closer to being a full thing, the perfectionist demons have grown louder. Because it is ALMOST what I had imagined in my brain, the small deviations from ideal feel even more painful.

But. I have learned a lot. And I have had a good time. I started typing this blog post so I'd have a markup file to test the blog formatting. Given that I'll have to write another one so I can fill out the documents directory the way I'd like, maybe it's best to call it here.

I can be proud of what I've made, imperfections and all. Afterall, if I don't love my creations, who will?
