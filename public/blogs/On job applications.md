# On job applications

Many people have been saying it's a rough jobs market right now. Myself included. 

I am so excited that I have received an offer from hackerOne! The interview process was wonderful, and each new person I talked to during hiring made me more excited to work there. If all goes well, I'll be starting on the 19th!

During my time unemployed, I applied for 309 job openings. 284 of those openings I applied to from April to July. The process was humbling. And tiring. But it taught me a lot.

One of the biggest things I learned early on was that it was much better to target my efforts. I noticed that I was wasting a lot of energy applying to job postings that had been posted over two months ago. I also found that when I didn't limit my search queries, I got so bogged down reading through thousands and thousands of postings that I would quickly lose focus.

What ended up working the best for me was to do a consistent, targeted amount of applying. Every day I would search for postings listed within the last 24 hours, open each of the jobs that seemed somewhat relevant to my skills in a new tab, and repeat this process until the search was exhausted. Then I would go through the tabs one by one, reading more about the role and company to ensure it was something I would be interested in doing before applying. Some days I was more selective than others.

The other thing that I learned was that it is very important for me to keep a log of the work that I had done. I would often spend large chunks of the day applying to jobs, only to get to the evening and feel like I had gotten nothing acocmplished. Having a spreadsheet I could return to in order to see progress over time helped me to see and value the efforts of the day. In news surprising no one, brain like when number go up.

I hope that when I start work I'll still have the energy and interest to work on personal projects in my free time. I do anticipate that they might be less coding centric and more grounded in the physical world. It would make me sad to stop working on this website. It has provided me with a lot of fun challenges and a wonderful sense of progression. I am grateful to it for giving me a gamified way of learning react. I hope that I can continue to use it to document other projects I make in the future.

If you are going through hard times or working on something where the results of your efforts are slow to pay off, I hope you can find a process that works for you.
