# Taking Space

I've been doing pretty well! I've got a new job, a new shirt, and a new fern. Me and Fernie Sanders, we're both thriving.

I have noticed that I have to push back against this voice inside of me at work. It wants desperately to not take up too much space. To not ask for a quick call to clarify something. To not message a second time when there are still things up in the air.

I've been thinking about something a friend said once. About how we exist TO take up space. That relying on each other is not a weakness, it's what makes us human.

I was able to help some friends recently. They crashed at my place for a couple of weeks. It was disruptive to my routines and a bit irritating at times to share my space. But it was also immensely rewarding. If it wasn't mildly inconvenient, it wouldn't be a favor.

So! I will continue to do my due diligance before asking questions, and also to not let pre-emptive guilt about mildly inconveniencing a team member get in the way of my growth and progress. After all, the sooner I get up to speed, the sooner I can start repaying the favors I have asked.

I'd also like to lay off the corporate distancing. I like my coworkers, they're genuinely nice to interact with. I don't want to view everything with them through a purely transactional lens. I want them to be people I support and am supported by. I want to put in the work and the vulnerability required to have meaningful lasting connections with these people.

Fernie Out.
