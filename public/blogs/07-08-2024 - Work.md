# Work

I have been putting a lot of pressure on myself and on this project. It has started to become something I think of first thing when I wake up, and something I'm still pondering as I try to sleep. I think it has become the bad work. The fervor that means I'm actively avoiding something else.

I'm not sure what that else could be. It might be the stress of upcoming interviews. It might be interpersonal or family matters. It might just be feeling old. My birthday is tomorrow. 

I hope that even in the thick of this work haze I can focus on what is important. And right now it is important to me to finish this project. Even if it's not all I want it to be yet.

So let's write this blog, and then publish it.

Lord knows it can't be any more embarassing than my previous attempt at a website last year. T_T
